# Smart Drone

This is a personal challenge as a total newb, to create a drone that is as smart as I can possibly make it.

It will begin as a set of goals and milesstones, I will be doing my best to document every nut and bolt. (Literally)


Initial equipmemt list will be as follows:
Jetson TX2 DevelopmDevelopment kit
Udoo x86
6-rotor copter kit
8-rotor drone from scratch  (Final goal)
