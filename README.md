# Smart Drone

This is a personal challenge as a total newb, to create a drone that is as smart as I can possibly make it.

It will begin as a set of goals and milestones, I will be doing my best to document every nut and bolt. (Literally)


Initial equipmemt list will be as follows:

* Electrical Control Brain - Udoo x86 

* Artificial Intellgence Brain - Jetson TX2 Development kit

* CSI Camera - Jetson TX2 Development kit Camera

* Eyes - Scanse Sweep

* Inner Ear? - Adafruit 10-Dof

* Test Body - S550 Kit

* Remote User Input - Turnigy X9 9-channel control (Heavily customized)

* Final Body - 8-rotor drone from scratch  (Final goal)

The project flow will be as follows:

- [x] Drone is assesmbled
- [x] Drone can be controlled directly with Turnigy X9
- [ ] Drone can self balance with Udoo / 10DoF
- [ ] Drone can communicate with laptop
- [ ] Drone can accept text commands
- [ ] Drone can accept / respond to text input (chatbot)
- [ ] Drone can see and hear (Image recognition, Audio recognition)
- [ ] Drone can learn from source material
- [ ] Drone can distinguish people
- [ ] Drone can distinguish voices
