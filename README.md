# Smart Drone

This is a personal challenge as a total newb, to create a drone that is as smart as I can possibly make it.

It will begin as a set of goals and milestones, I will be doing my best to document every nut and bolt. (Literally)


Initial equipmemt list will be as follows:

* Jetson TX2 Development kit

* Udoo x86

* Turnigy X9 9-channel control

* razor 9dof

* 6-rotor copter kit

* 8-rotor drone from scratch  (Final goal)


The project flow will be as follows:

1. Drone is assesmbled
2. Drone can be controlled directly with Turnigy X9
3. Drone can self balance with Udoo / Razor AHRS
4. Drone can see and hear
5. Drone can communicate with laptop
6. Drone can learn from source material
7. Drone can distinguish people
8. Drone can distinguish voices
