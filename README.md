# Smart Drone

This is a personal challenge as a total newb, to create a drone that is as smart as I can possibly make it.

It will begin as a set of goals and milestones, I will be doing my best to document every nut and bolt. (Literally)


Initial equipmemt list will be as follows:

* Jetson TX2 Development kit

* Udoo x86

* Turnigy X9 9-channel control

* Scanse Sweep

* razor 9dof

* 6-rotor copter kit

* 8-rotor drone from scratch  (Final goal)


The project flow will be as follows:

- [ ] Drone is assesmbled
- [ ] Drone can be controlled directly with Turnigy X9
- [ ] Drone can self balance with Udoo / Razor AHRS
- [ ] Drone can communicate with laptop
- [ ] Drone can accept text commands
- [ ] Drone can accept / respond to text input (chatbot)
- [ ] Drone can see and hear (Image recognition, Audio recognition)
- [ ] Drone can learn from source material
- [ ] Drone can distinguish people
- [ ] Drone can distinguish voices
